      <description>Illumina has so many machines on the market these days, it has become hard to keep it all straight.
This table was compiled mainly from the tables Illumina has here &amp;ndash; but all in one table, and with more information re: chemistry and flowcell technology.

      <description>I recently read about &amp;ldquo;QuickBLASTP, an accelerated version of BLASTP&amp;rdquo; that is now available in the online BLAST application. There is a question on the NCBI announcement page, asking &amp;ldquo;Does exits the possibility of downloading the corresponding executables so we can try it locally?&amp;rdquo; but no answer is provided.
I sent this question to the help desk and got a disappointing reply.

      <title>Hunting for the perfect codon aware aligner</title>

      <guid>https://biocozy.net/posts/2014-05-16-hunting-for-the-perfect-codon-aware-aligner/</guid>
      <description>Yesterday I went looking for a well-behaved codon-aware aligner. A question that has been brought up on both Stack Overflow and BioStars.
What I discovered is that many software projects that claim to be codon aligners are actually just (1) translating the nucleotide sequence to an amino acid seqeunce, (2) aligning the amino acid sequencing, and (3) mapping the a.a. alignment structure to the nucleotide sequences, in a codon-by-codon fashion.</description>

      <title>Color palettes in R (wrt ggplot2)</title>

      <description>I just found an outstanding rundown of color issues in R (with a nod to ggplot2) on cookbook-r.com.
Mostly just a collection of resources from around the web.
I really like their colorblind friendly palette:

      <description>How big is this news? Well, bigger than 4 GB, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure.
A while back I brought up this issue on BioStars.
From the Bowtie2 news page:
Version 2.2.0 - February 10, 2014  Improved index querying efficiency using &amp;ldquo;population count&amp;rdquo; instructions available since SSE4.2 Added support for large and small indexes, removing 4-billion-nucleotide barrier. Bowtie 2 can now be used with reference genomes of any size. Fixed bug that could cause bowtie2-build to crash when reference length is close to 4 billion.</description>

      <description>I had difficulties figuring out how to use pip to install a specific branch from a github repo. Because of my corporate firewall, all of the other methods that you can find around on various websites did not work for me. This is the method that worked:
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/h3/django-dajaxice.git@django-1.5+  Of course, I have http_proxy and https_proxy set and exported.</description>

      <title>Making sense of Python version madness and pip/setuptools/virtualenv game</title>

      <description>This posting is motivated by cases where you are stuck using an older server OS (CentOS 5.8 in this case) and want to install an up-to-date python 2.7 along with a raft of necessary packages. What is the best way?
distribute? pip? setuptools? virtualenv? What to make of all this?
Bottom line: use pip. To install pip, you either install it from source, or else install virtualenv (which includes pip). Installing from source allows you to manage packages with pip globally on your system (and not in a virtual environment), then you have to install pip from source.</description>

      <description>Here I am writing out some of the details of my tophat/cufflinks RNA-Seq workflow. I will try to concisely summarize what works and what pitfalls to avoid. None of what follows is particularly cutting edge, but since these analyses often involve days of computation, each and every trial-and-error glitch adds up and sets you back. This document is intended to help you avoid such setbacks.

      <title>Getting yum to work with RHEL / RHN behind a proxy</title>

~/.bash_profile
export http_proxy=http://proxyserver.company.com:8080
export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxyserver.company.com:8080
The thing is, there is no universal agreement among linux command line programs, some seem to use HTTP_PROXY and some use http_proxy. So, yes, export http_proxy both as lower and UPPER case!
And complicating the picture is that RHN doesn&amp;rsquo;t use either of these &amp;ndash; it pulls the settings out of /etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date</description>

      <description>I mean, I totally agree with the conclusions, but, um, is there a conflict of interest here? Just sayin.
A Comprehensive Evaluation of Alignment Algorithms in the Context of RNA-Seq
&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; Our results clearly showed the significant reduction in memory footprint and runtime provided by FM-index based aligners at a precision and recall comparable to the best hash table based aligners. Furthermore, the recently developed Bowtie 2 alignment algorithm shows a remarkable tolerance to both sequencing errors and indels, thus, essentially making hash-based aligners obsolete.</description>

Install and compile samtools from source. I built it with fPIC flags like this:
make CXXFLAGS=-fPIC CFLAGS=-fPIC CPPFLAGS=-fPIC
Be sure that the file libbam.a that you just created with the fPIC flag is (also) present in the lib directory. I had to rename the old one and copy the new one there.

      <description>I love the plyr package and use ddply very often. But it becomes ungainly with big data.
I found out about data.table today. Basically, it&amp;rsquo;s indexed data frames, allowing binary search operations.
Their quick start guide has this footnote:
&amp;ldquo;We wonder how many people are deploying parallel techniques to code that is vector scanning&amp;rdquo;
(Yep, that was me. And yes, crazy that I am only discovering data.table in 2013.)
But I see the light now!</description>

I have a dataset composed of 3 technical replicates &amp;ndash; exactly the same library, run in 3 separate hi-seq lanes (multiplexed along with other samples, but I am ignoring those for now.) They were run on an Illumina HiSeq 2000, with 101 bp paired-end reads.</description>

      <description>RStudio (http://www.rstudio.com/) has to be one of the coolest pieces of software I have installed in recent memory.
RStudio provides a very well-planned and well-executed IDE for R. This alone would be a reason to sing Hosanna.

But it gets better!!! The Server package (deb and rpm packages available) allows you access to this same interface via a webserver, so you can run R on a beefy computational server from any web browser.</description>

      <description>Oh, Barcodes, How do I obtain thee? Let me count the ways:
1) Internal to one of the reads
2) Printed in the header:
3) Encoded in the header
4) In a separate file
There are many tools out there to deal with multiplexed read data.
fastx_barcode_splitter.pl(from FASTX_Toolkit)
fastq-multx (from ea-utils)
split_libraries_fastq.py (from QIIME)
As far as I know, none of the above adequately deal with case (4) above. The QIIME tools does, but appears to turn the fastq into a fasta file in the process (?</description>

      <description>When you ask bwa to report multiple hits, it has a very strange behavior.
I am addressing this behavior, highlighted in bold below, and especially the part in yellow italic bold (this is from the bwa manual):
    samse bwa samse [-n maxOcc] &amp;gt;

      <description>Here is how you can extract raw fastq files from Illumina BCL data.
This will give you raw fastq files. No demultiplexing. Just the reads, and nothin&amp;rsquo; but the reads.
Read 1 is generally the forward read, Read 2 is generally the index read, and Read 3 is generally the reverse read.
You might want to do this if you want to see the barcode read quality scores, which you may want to consider to do a more accurate demultiplexing.</description>

      <description>You may already know that the linux join command requires sorted fields to work properly &amp;ndash; after all, it tells you so right in the man page:
Important: FILE1 and FILE2 must be sorted on the join fields.
But I just found out the hard way that it must be an alphanumeric sort, not a numeric sort.
Lesson learned.</description>

      <description>Easiest possible solution, and I believe significantly faster than awk-based methods:
sed -n &#39;1~4s/^@/&amp;gt;/p;2~4p&#39;  The only assumption made is that each read occupies exactly 4 lines in the FASTQ file, but that seems pretty safe, in my experience.
If you find this helpful, go up-vote my answer in StackOverflow.</description>

      <description>As much as I hate FTP, there situations where one must use it. I finally have settled on the best way to get an entire directory, with recursive file retrieval:
lftp -e &amp;ldquo;mirror dir1/subdir2/subdir3&amp;rdquo; -u username,password ftphost.domain.com
Of course, FTP must die, but until then, I am glad there is lftp.</description>

      <description>When I first found GNU parallel last fall, I thought it was the bee&amp;rsquo;s knees. So well conceived, so well executed, so well documented&amp;hellip; so generous to the user, and most of all, so darn handy.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it extensively with the ::: notation to feed data files into a pipeline in parallel, and it does exactly what I want it to do.
But today it goes to a whole new level, as I realize there is a whole other side to the tool: the ability to feed parts of a single input file into a pipeline in parallel.</description>

      <description>There is a great answer on stack overflow showing how to feed one output stream into multiple processes. It is a little bit of a hack of the excellent tool tee, which I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for some time. Normally, tee take stout and writes it to a file, while passing it along to stout. This solution provided on s.o. shows how to hack this with the bash trick &amp;gt;(process) &amp;ndash; so as far as tee knows, it is writing to 2 or more files, but the &amp;ldquo;files&amp;rdquo; are actually background processes.</description>

## get mirbase18 annotation and convert to a bed like format wget ftp://mirbase.org/pub/mirbase/CURRENT/genomes/hsa.gff grep -v &amp;quot;#&amp;quot; hsa.gff | cut -f 1,4,5,9 &amp;gt;mirbase18.temp1 grep -v &amp;quot;#&amp;quot; hsa.gff | cut -f 6,7 &amp;gt;mirbase18.temp2 paste mirbase18.temp1 mirbase18.temp2 | sed s/^/chr/ &amp;gt;mirbase18.</description>

      <description>How can I use wget to get a recursive directory listing of an entire FTP site?
yes, wget &amp;ndash;no-remove-listing ftp://myftpserver/ftpdirectory/ will get and retain a directory listing for a single directory (which was discussed here)
but, wget -r &amp;ndash;no-remove-listing ftp://myftpserver/ftpdirectory/ will recurse and download an entire site
so, if you want to get the recursive directory structure, but not download the entire site, try wget -r &amp;ndash;no-remove-listing &amp;ndash;spider ftp://myftpserver/ftpdirectory/</description>

      <description>Larry Moran has an excellent discussion of the organization of rRNA genes in the human genome. It&amp;rsquo;s an old post, but a good one.
If you&amp;rsquo;re involved in RNA-Seq, you should read it. Dr. Moran&amp;rsquo;s discussion makes it clear why it is necessary to map reads to a synthetic rRNA-ome before doing full-genome alignment &amp;ndash; if you want to accurately count, or filter out, rRNA reads (which can predominate in RNA-seq datasets).</description>

      <description>I wanted to remove all sequences less than n long from a fastq file. This is a solution that uses sed &amp;ldquo;paragraphs&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; see my earlier post. It works&amp;hellip; could probably be done more efficiently&amp;hellip; but this works for me, for now.
Save this as a script, and then use in this manner:
./fastqlenfilt.sh 15 input.fastq &amp;gt;output.filtered.fastq
#!/bin/sh sed -n &#39; # thanks to http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html # # if matching description, check the paragraph /^@/ b para # else add it to the hold buffer H # at end of file, check paragraph $ b para # now branch to end of script b # this is where a paragraph is checked for the pattern :para # return the entire paragraph # into the pattern space x # look for the pattern, if there - print # /&#39;.</description>

dpkg -L will show you what files came with an installed package
apt-file, which needs to be installed first, will tell you what package provides a given file. Actually, it can also replicate the same thing that dpkg -L does, see below:

      <description>While it may be a convenient and flexible solution when reading in 10s or 100s or 1000s of sequences, the SeqIO module of BioPerl is just not a workable solution for reading in Next Gen Sequencing files.
 Consider reading in 100,000 short reads from a fastq file:
It takes 30 seconds to do it the bioperl way:
use Bio::SeqIO;
my $seqin = Bio::SeqIO-&amp;gt;new(-format =&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;fastq&amp;rdquo;,-file =&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;infilename&amp;rdquo;,);

      <description>Found this very handy script that allows you to access a Time Machine created backup, which Apple engineered (almost) too cleverly.
Handy if you want to copy files off of a backup, directly to a linux computer, for example.</description>

      <title>parallel computation using the caret package</title>

      <guid>https://biocozy.net/posts/2009-10-05-parallel-computation-using-the-caret-package/</guid>
      <description>Library caret is a wonderful R package for tuning a variety of machine learning classification and regression algorithms. But it can take a long time to run, since model tuning usually involves running multiple bootstrapped replicates for each point in your tuning grid.
If you have a multi-core desktop machine, you can speed up your calls to the caret function train by using explicit parallelism.
There were just a couple hitches to get it flying on my 64bit quad core Optiplex 960 running linux kernel 2.</description>

library(multicore)

job2 &amp;lt;- mcparallel(bigMachingLeaningFunction2())
job3 &amp;lt;- mcparallel(bigMachingLeaningFunction3())
job4 &amp;lt;- mcparallel(bigMachingLeaningFunction4())
###### time goes by &amp;hellip;..
results1 &amp;lt;- collect(job1)
results2 &amp;lt;- collect(job2)
results3 &amp;lt;- collect(job3)
results4 &amp;lt;- collect(job4)
Note to emacs ESS users &amp;ndash; just be sure all your libraries are already loaded, and set silent=TRUE in the mcparallel call&amp;hellip;.</description>

library(hgu133plus2.db)
hgu133plus2_dbschema()
sql = &amp;ldquo;
select * from probes p, gene_info g, chromosome_locations c 
where g._id=c._id and g._id=p._id limit 10
&amp;ldquo;
dbGetQuery(hgu133plus2_dbconn(), sql)
If you look at the last few page of the manual for AnnotationDbi [site, PDF], you will see some tips about joining different databases together.</description>

      <description>This post could be entitled &amp;ldquo;Error: cannot allocate vector of size 256.0 Mb&amp;rdquo;. R provides this maddening response for even the most trivial seeming tasks. I have a 4 Gb linux system, and I have encountered this error message for &amp;ldquo;vector of size&amp;rdquo; in the 10s of Mb. And system wide, there appears to be plenty of memory still available, and the swap space hasn&amp;rsquo;t been touched.
What&amp;rsquo;s going on with R memory management?</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you&amp;rsquo;ve at times been frustrated by the looseness of the R package system. These are some of the facts of life in the R world:
 There are often many different functions with overlapping goals [for example, princomp() and prcomp()].
 The names of a packages may have little or no relationship to the functions in that package (for example, package &amp;ldquo;e1071&amp;rdquo; provides the tune() function for parameter tuning).</description>

      <description>R does some amazing things, and often seems to know just want you want to do. Data type &amp;ldquo;coercion&amp;rdquo; can also backfire.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just realized the considerable power and convenience of a web-based bioinformatic resource I have overlooked in the past: biomart.org.
What gets my attention now is the ability to integrate BioMart queries right into your BioConductor pipeline, with a package called biomaRt
The Seattle 2009 BioConductor workshop looks like it was great &amp;ndash; sadly, I missed it. But you can still access some presentation materials on biomaRt.
Installation of biomaRt is accomplished like any other BioConductor pacakge:</description>

      <description>I just discovered how easy Bioconductor makes it to import data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
First, be sure you have the GEOquery package from Bioconductor. You will probably need to install the curl4 devel library package using apt-get or whatever you use to do such things. On my Ubuntu 8.10 distro, the requisite package is called libcurl4-gnutls-dev. After you have this, you should be able to install GEOquery like any other Bioconductor package, ie:</description>

I could not get various packages to compile, until I installed
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libatlas-base-dev
This solved many build problems, including package XML, but I was still getting the following error when attempting to load library vsn:
