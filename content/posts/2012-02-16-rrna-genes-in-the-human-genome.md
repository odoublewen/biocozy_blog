Larry Moran has an excellent discussion of the [organization of rRNA
genes](http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/01/human-ribosomal-rna-genes.html)
in the human genome.  It's an old post, but a good one.  
  
If you're involved in RNA-Seq, you should read it.  Dr. Moran's
discussion makes it clear why it is necessary to map reads to a
synthetic rRNA-ome before doing full-genome alignment -- if you want to
accurately count, or filter out, rRNA reads (which can predominate in
RNA-seq datasets).
