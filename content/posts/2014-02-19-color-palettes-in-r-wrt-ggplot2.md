I just found an [outstanding rundown of color
issues](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_%28ggplot2%29/) in R
(with a nod to ggplot2) on cookbook-r.com.  
  
Mostly just a collection of resources from around the web.  
  
I really like their colorblind friendly palette:

Which is better than the ggplot2 defaults:
