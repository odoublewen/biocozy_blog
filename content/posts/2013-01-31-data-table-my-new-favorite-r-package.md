I love the plyr package and use ddply very often.  But it becomes
ungainly with big data.  
  
I found out about [data.table](http://datatable.r-forge.r-project.org/)
today.  Basically, it's indexed data frames, allowing binary search
operations.  
  
Their quick start guide has this footnote:  
  
"We wonder how many people are deploying parallel techniques to code
that is vector scanning"  
  
(Yep, that was me.  And yes, crazy that I am only discovering data.table
in 2013.)  
  
But I see the light now!  Take me to the water and set me down!
