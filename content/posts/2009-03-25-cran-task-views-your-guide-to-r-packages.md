If you're like me, you've at times been frustrated by the looseness of
the R package system. These are some of the facts of life in the R
world:  

-   There are often many different functions with overlapping goals
    \[for example, princomp() and prcomp()\].  
-   The names of a packages may have little or no relationship to the
    functions in that package (for example, package "e1071" provides the
    tune() function for parameter tuning).
-   There doesn't seem to be any organized, curated guide to the
    packages.

Well, at least the last point on this list of frustrations has been
remedied. Be sure to check out the [CRAN Task
Views](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) pages, which has exactly
that: lists of packages with a brief blurb about each one, organized by
topics (more than 20 at this writing), curated by (I assume) expert R
users/developers.  
  
My favorite guides at the moment are [Machine
Learning](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MachineLearning.html), and
[Multivariate
Statistics](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Multivariate.html).  
  
Keep in mind, the above guides do not include BioConductor packages --
for that, you will still go to the [BioConductor
website](http://www.bioconductor.org/).
