As much as I hate FTP, there situations where one must use it. Â I
finally have settled on the best way to get an entire directory, with
recursive file retrieval:

lftp -e "mirror dir1/subdir2/subdir3" -u username,password
ftphost.domain.com

Of course, [FTP must die](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/FtpMustDie), but
until then, I am glad there is [lftp](http://lftp.yar.ru/).
