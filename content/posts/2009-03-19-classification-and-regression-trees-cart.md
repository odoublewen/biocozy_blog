Just about the take the plunge into various machine learning analyses,
starting with some simple classification and regression trees (CART) to
try to model patient outcomes based on clinical observations. I'll be
mainly focusing on classification.  
  
In gearing up for this, I just found an amazing resource, this [guide to
machine learning R
packages](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MachineLearning.html),
maintained by [Torsten
Hothorn](http://www.statistik.lmu.de/%7Ehothorn/).
