Illumina has so many machines on the market these days, it has become hard to keep it all straight.

This table was compiled mainly from the tables Illumina has [here](https://www.illumina.com/systems/sequencing-platforms.html) -- but all in one table, and with more information re: chemistry and flowcell technology.

Platform          |  Run Time        |  Max Output  |  Max Reads/Run  |  Max Len  |  Scale                |  Flowcells   |  Chemistry
