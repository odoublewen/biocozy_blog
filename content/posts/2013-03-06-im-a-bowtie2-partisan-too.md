I mean, I totally agree with the conclusions, but, um, is there a
conflict of interest here?  Just sayin.

"... Our results clearly showed the significant reduction in memory
footprint and runtime provided by FM-index based aligners at a precision
and recall comparable to the best hash table based aligners. <span

Bowtie 2 alignment algorithm shows a remarkable tolerance to both
sequencing errors and indels</span>, thus, essentially making hash-based
aligners obsolete."
