Dashboard seems like a good idea, but I can't stand how it always seems
to take 5 seconds to "wake up" all those widgets whenever I open it up.
So, as a result, I never use it. Â It just idles there in the background
taking up a sliver of CPU cycles. Oh and occasionally I accidentally key
into it. So, I am glad I finally did
[this](http://www.macworld.com/article/46236/2005/08/disabledashboard.html):  
  
`defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean YES`  
  
`killall Dock`
