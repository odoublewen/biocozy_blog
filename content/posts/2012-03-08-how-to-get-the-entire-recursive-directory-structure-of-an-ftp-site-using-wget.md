How can I use wget to get a recursive directory listing of an entire FTP
site?

yes, wget --no-remove-listing ftp://myftpserver/ftpdirectory/ will get
and retain a directory listing for a single directory (which was
discussed
[here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7261140/wget-only-the-file-names-in-an-ftp-directory))

but, wget -r --no-remove-listing ftp://myftpserver/ftpdirectory/ will
recurse and download an entire site

so, if you want to get the recursive directory structure, but not
download the entire site, tryÂ wget -r --no-remove-listing --spider
ftp://myftpserver/ftpdirectory/
